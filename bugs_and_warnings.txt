<Cautions/Warnings/Bugs>

1. Format of the dispersion file isn't super important for CamCASP calculation,
but the main_dispersion routine is pretty finicky on format. Need to ensure
the following:
    a. 'Charge 0' (or whatever actual charge) line must directly precede
        geometry input line.

2. In templates/isa_template.clt, you'll need to replace the path in the
'#include' line with the appropriate absolute path to your installation of
CamCASP.
