# Hard Sphere cutoff parameters:
#
# Parameters below are used to define minimum and maximum acceptable distances
# for neighbor-neighbor interactions.  'cutoff_type' can either be set to
# 'absolute' or 'vdw'. In the former case, the hard sphere cutoff will be set
# to the absolute distances (in Angstroms) given by cutoff_min and cutoff_max,
# respectively. In the latter case, the hard sphere cutoff will be set to a
# fraction of the Van der Waals distance between two atoms. 
cutoff_type     vdw   # either vdw or absolute
cutoff_min         0.8    # a positive float (ex. 0.8 for vdw or 2.0 for absolute)
cutoff_max         1.3   # a positive float (ex. 1.2 for vdw or 6.0 for absolute)

# The following are parameters defining the centers of monomer's a and b as well as the scan
# vector. 
#
# The 'center' of each monomer is defined by default to be each
# monomer's center of mass, but can also be set to be either the center of an
# atom or a point in 3-space (relative to monomer coordinates given in input
# geometry file).
mona_origin_type  1   # choose 0 for center of mass (COM), 1 for atom#, and 2 for a specific point
mona_origin       6     # (either 'COM', point x,y,z , or atom# in monomer (indexing starts at 1), depending on choice of mona_origin_type above)
monb_origin_type  1   # choose 0 for COM, 1 for atom#, and 2 for a specific point
monb_origin       6    # (either 'COM', point x,y,z , or atom# in monomer (indexing starts at 1), depending on choice of mona_origin_type above)

# The scan vector should be a vector (given relative to the coordinates in
# monomer a) that defines the direction of internuclear seperation between the
# two monomers. It can either be given as a 3-membered list or by listing two
# monomer indices (scan vector will point from atom1 to atom2, indexing starts at 1).
scan_vector_type  0  # choose 0 for monomer indices, 1 for a specific point
scan_vector    9,6   # Give either as a 2 (if scan_vector_type==0) or a 3 (if scan_vector_type==1) membered, 
                      # comma seperated list without spaces, i.e. '1.0,2.7,4.2' (no quotes)

# Set bounds on moving the center of monomer b relative to the center of
# monomer a. min/max_r refers to the distance between the centers, while theta
# and phi correspond to the azimuthal and polar angles, respectively, of
# rotation about the vector scan_vector (given above).
#
# Give min/max angles as either integers/floats in terms of pi (i.e. setting
# 'max_theta 2' (no quotes) will yield  max_theta=2pi).
